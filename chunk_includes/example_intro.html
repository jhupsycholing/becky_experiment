<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>

The goal of the project is to measure what makes particular aspects of language easier or harder

to learn and understand.

<h3><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></h3>

Only native English speakers should participate in this study.

<h3><b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b></h3>

In each trial, you will be presented with two sentences. You will read each sentence carefully and decide which of the two is more "acceptable" than the other. For instance, if the sentences were "The dogs in the park are happy" and "The dogs in the park is happy", then you would choose the first sentence, since it does not contain a grammatical error. You make click the sentence to choose it, or you may press the 1 or 2 key to choose. To ensure that your submission is accepted, be sure to read each sentence and choose your response carefully. Your goal should be accuracy, not speed.
